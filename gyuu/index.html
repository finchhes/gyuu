                                    <br>
                                    30.03.25
                                </span>
                                <br><br>
                                recently we went all in and became a neocities supporter. in the moment it was for the
                                ease of using more niche filetypes (like miles' page which has a .glb file.) yes, we
                                couldve just used a file hosting service to fix this issue, or switched to nekoweb which
                                doesn't have file restrictions. hell- a lot of other options are cheaper and more
                                efficient than neocities. so why?
                                <br><br>
                                neocities gives kids on the internet a real chance to learn what i think is one of the
                                most important skills to have right now. it packages this really important thing into a
                                format that is much more accessible and easy to learn. it brings back customisability in
                                online spaces, while not isolating you from a community.
                                <br><br>
                                sure, the indie web will exist regardless of neocities, but it really gives people the
                                chance to find a community and to ease the transition for a very chronically online
                                generation.
                                <br><br>
                                we deleted tiktok in september of last year. havent touched it since, any links we get
                                sent are opened in a browser. the decision wasnt made to get off of the platform, but it
                                ended up being exactly what we needed. the same can be said for us on most other
                                socials. we only use twitter for our partners, having a private account with just them
                                on it. instagram is only really for hockey and cyber-stalking celebrities. its something
                                that we never thought we would be able to do- get off of it all and live as ourselves,
                                not so focused on what others think of us.
                                <br><br>
                                neocities gives kids a chance to never go down the rabbit holes that i have went through
                                on the internet, to save themselves from the addiction and the insanity it will put them
                                through. to live for themselves, form their own opinions and experiences without the
                                backlash online spaces will give them.
                                <br><br>
                                why neocities? because if it can save someone from modern day social media, my 5 dollars
                                is worth it for that alone.

                                been a little bit! we're working on some pages and tinkering with the homepage a lot.
                                pretty busy week but it's nice to have a break to chat.
                                <br><br>
                                hope you're all doing well! up to a few followers. we did some thinking about making
                                this an iframe or a seperate page, but honestly i think less noticeable updates to it
                                will make it much easier to update this without stress.

                                things have been very overwhelming, dealing with family issues and planning to move
                                later this year. it adds up quickly, especially with being a caretaker for the past few
                                days due to an injury. hoping things can turn up soon!
                                <br><br>
                                quite a lot has changed since the last journal update from tao, the entirety of this
                                homepage was redesigned and the landing page is now a thing.
                                <br><br>
                                life gets harder and harder, but i hope it gets better.

                                how

                                looking in a bit but for now... here we are. pretty simple layout, again i just wanted
                                something
                                that i could
                                easily add to and use just one stylesheet for.
                                <br><br>
                                things have been a bit down for me as of late, but its getting better slowly. i think
                                this
                                will
                                help
                                a bit, just
                                to get some thoughts down.
                                <br><br>
                                i made a painting a few days ago, nothing special but i needed to get off of the
                                computer
                                somehow.
                                helped a lot,
                                but i'm not great at painting so it was more of just me slapping colours onto each other
                                and
                                making
                                them look
                                pretty kind of.
